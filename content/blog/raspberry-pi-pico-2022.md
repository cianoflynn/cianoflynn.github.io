Summary:

Raspberry Pi Trading are the UK based company behind the development of the RP2040 microcontroller chip. They released a board called the 'Pi Pico', which includes this microcontroller in January of 2021. 

The boards are designed for low cost (around around â‚¬5 each) and mass production. 

It's possible to program the Pico with C and MicroPython (a version of Python language, optimized to run on a microcontroller). 

The market for these boards seems to be education, prototyping and electronics hobbyists.


I've had a Pico for a couple of months, and using online instructions I've made the following accessories...

1. VGA Interface

The RP2040 has a feature called 'Programmable Input/Output', or ['PIO'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODlB05xMg04) which gives the Pico to be ability to produce a VGA signal. 

2. SD Card Reader

Here is the micro-sd card read installed in the breadboard. (The jumper wires are not connected)

3. Reset Button.
