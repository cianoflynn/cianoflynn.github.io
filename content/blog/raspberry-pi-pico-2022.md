Summary:

Raspberry Pi Trading are the UK based company behind the development of the RP2040 microcontroller chip. They released a board called the 'Pi Pico', which includes this microcontroller in January of 2021. 

The boards are designed for low cost (around around â‚¬5) and mass production.  


I received one a couple of months ago, and using online instructions I have make the following accessories for the Pico.

1. VGA Interface

Here is the micro-sd card read installed in the breadboard. (The jumper wires are not connected)
