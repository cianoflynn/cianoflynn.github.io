The cost was £79.99 in the UK, and €109.99 in the Republic of Ireland. A bit more expensive in Ireland.

This bandsaw is essentially a rebranded Scheppach HBS20 8" Bandsaw. Reading the manual we see the 3 year warrenty is covered by [Scheppach.com](https://www.scheppach.com) it also refers to the bandsaw as being a model HBS20.

After removing everything from the box, there is minimal assembly required. The included instructions follow Aldi's standard product manual format. So, everything is clear and easy to follow.

This is not big bandsaw. The Throat (Distance from saw blade to inner part of the machine) is 200mm and the Depth of cut (Distance from table to top of saw guide at maximum extension) is 80mm. It's adequte for most jobs.

The target market for this saw is the hobby, home use DIYers but it looks quite solid and seems to be constructed of good quality materials.

Opening the housing with the included screw driver we can see the upper and lower balanced cast alloy wheels which carry the blade. These are running on sealed for life bearings. The lower wheel is driven by a powerful 350 Watt induction motor which is rated as [S2](http://www.rotor.co.uk/dutycycle/duty_cycle.html) with a 30 minutee run time.

There a number of [adjustments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBbFBf5t0Kk) that can be made to the machine. The main adjustment are the thrust bearing position and blade guides.

The machine comes with a plastic push stick which has a hanger on the side. There are limit switches on both the upper and lower doors of the housing, these safety features prevents activation of the machine when servicing the blade.

You can set the Depth of cut by adjusting the tool post, which works on a rack and pinion system. There no scale on the Depth of cut, but this isn't a bit issue since you can set the height of the cut against the piece you're working with.

The saws table is held in place by a single sided trunnion, which allows you to tilt the table to 45 degrees.
###Possible Additions/Improvements###

* Stand and wheel kit
* Replacement blades from [TuffSaw](http://www.tuffsaws.co.uk/)
* Addition of a mitre fence
